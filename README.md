CSS 360 Project: music player for senior citizens


New code for the player adds a settings window and rough file parser integration. Make sure to copy File_Parser.jar and parser.bat to the root build folder before running. If you encouter errors then from the build menu go to Build -> clean all, then Build -> Run qmake. After this everything should run fine.
